        <p>
          Probably because of boredom and i wanna learn a little about programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also do this for the CS50x final project. so, i search a bunch of ideas, and i think doing three JS might be interesting

        <h2>🏋️ what i did</h2>

        <h3>Bodybuilding</h3>
        <p>
          back then i was sick and tired of being sick and tired. So at 13 Years old i decided to try to do sport
        </p>
        <p>
          i don't like cardio since the beginning, so i tried out doing some push ups and very basic calisthenics moves that i watched on Youtube.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br> and then i realize that i enjoy the feeling of it. The feeling of trying to better myself, the feeling of the pump, the motivation and dopamine.
        </p>
        <p>
          i decided to join a gym after a couple of months training at home. And those stereotype where "gym people were douchebag were wrong in my experience"
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="right">
        <p>
          and then a year later i decide to do a bodybuilding contest. despite being 14, coming final exams in an accelerated class on my elementary school
          and the fact that i was just one year into serious training. I still wanna do it
        </p>
        <p>
          <br> i read books and watch videos about contenst prep from people like Layne norton, Jeff Nippard, etc. Did my prep in 4 months
          and went to the show. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Only able to get to the semifinal, but hey the point of a fitness journey is to be a better version of yourself from your past. Not comparing yourself
          to other people progress
